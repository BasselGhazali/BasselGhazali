### Hey There
I’m passionate about all things technology, as well as the strategy involved in setting it up for success. I studied engineering to establish a techie base, then moved into consulting to have the most impact in the field.

### I'm currently learning 
All things related to Web3 technologies. I'm learning how the bitcoin code works, as well as learning how to develop decentralised applications using a mix of Solidity for smart contract development and ReactJS for building the application logic.

### When I’m not staring at a computer to work on technology
I like to disconnect by staring at another computer to create digital art. I wanted to use my creativity to help spread peace and mindfulness, so I'm creating an art brand. Lineart's coming soon!

### When I don't want to stare at a computer screen
I sometimes head out into nature. There, I stare into my camera screen. I love capturing rare moments in nature, and capturing the hidden world around us through macro-photography.

### Fun fact
I caught a bear when I was 14. Teddy wasn’t harmed and is still living happily with her friend Baloo at the Animal Encounter, a wildlife conservation center in Aley, Lebanon.
