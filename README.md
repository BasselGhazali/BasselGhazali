### Hi there 👋

💻 I’m passionate about all things technology, as well as the strategy involved in setting it up for success. I studied engineering to establish a techie base, then moved into consulting to have the most impact in the field.

🔗🌱 I'm currently playing around with: Web3 technologies.

🎨 When I’m not staring at a computer to work on technology: I like to disconnect by staring at another computer to create digital art. I wanted to use my creativity to help spread peace and mindfulness, so I'm creating an art brand. Lineart's coming soon!

📷 I sometimes head out into nature to get away from computer screens. There, I stare into my camera screen. I love capturing rare moments in nature, and capturing the hidden world around us through macro-photography.

🐻 Fun fact: I caught a bear when I was 14. Teddy wasn’t harmed and is still living happily with her friend Baloo at the Animal Encounter, a wildlife conservation center in Aley, Lebanon.
